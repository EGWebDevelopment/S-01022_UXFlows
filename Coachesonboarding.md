## Description
Coaches would be invited by EG admins. The invitation would include a hyperlink which takes them to a special area of the site where they respond to specific questions about their team. The user would navigate forward by clicking on "next" or "skip." The onboarding flow would include:
### Welcome Screen
Includes a brief introduction and a video the user can watch
### Get Support
Shows an embed of our vcita scheduling form as well as contact information for EduGuide.
### Send Invitation to IT Contact
When the user enters  their IT contact's name and email address, we would send an email to them asking them to complete some technical changes to the school's network.
### Enter Team Information
User is prompted to enter the team's name and upload an avatar. If the team's name has already been entered, the text would be displayed here and would be editable.
### Invite Team Coaches 
Coach is prompted for the name and email addresses for the people who they would like to have serve as team coaches on the team. They can also enter an optional message to be included in the invitation which would go out.
##348 Inviting Team Coaches
Staff admins would initiate the process of getting a lead coach started in their team by clicking on a link that is visible only to admins. The link could be labeled "Send invite to lead coach." This would take them to a page which looks similar to the general team invitation page. They would enter the recipient's name and email address as well as a customized message. Only one message can be send at a time.
